# Hangman

### Python Project - [AiCore](https://www.theaicore.com/) (October 2023)

## About The Project

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

This game is played on the Command Line Interface.

WHAT HAVE I LEARNT ON THE WAY:

- I've learnt how to implement the principles of Object Oriented Programming.
- How to use `if __init__ == "__main__"` to prevent imported code from being run on import.
- How to implement list comprehensions
- How to use set operations to determine unique elements
- How to use `while True:` loops to continue prompting for user input until the user input is inputted correctly
- How to maintain version control using git and GitHub.
